CSS

CSS Stands for Cascading style sheets. It is used to program the look of a webpage.
It allows you to set rules that specify how the content of an element should appear. For example, background, foreground, font type and color.

CSS creates rules to control the look of different elements. 

Rules are made up of Selectors and Declarations. 
Selectors indicate which element is being modified and Declarations specify how.
Declarations themselves are made up of Properties and Values separated by a colon. One declaration can have multiple properties separated my semicolons. 
Properties indicate what you wanrt to change about the element and Values what you're using.

When creating a site you can use either internal or external CSS (either embedding a link to the style sheet or coding it directly into the html)
It's reccomended to use external css when creating a site with more than one page to have uniformity and cut down on time used to edit the style. 

There are quite a few selectors used in css some key ones are:

-Universal *
-Type h1, h2
-Class .
-ID #


There are block elements, that start a new line and inline elements that fall within the line in CSS:

-RGB Values
-Hex Codes
-Color Names
