##Growth Mindset

>“Someday, somewhere — anywhere, unfailingly, you'll find yourself, and that, and only that, can be the happiest or bitterest hour of your life.” - Pablo Neruda>

To me growth mindset is about lifelong learning. We as humans are **constantly** learning, growing and changing (look at madonna). Through new experiences and skills we shape and reshape who we are over the years. Looking back, I'm not the same person I was ten years ago, and I won't be the same ten years from now and that's agood thing. 
To keep myself on the right track I'll try to use this mindset by telling myself the following:

1. Don't give up, I'm capable of doing difficult things.
1. No pain,no gain - You'll never improve if you don't challenge yourself.
1.Grow in all aspects - Challenge yourself in everything you do.

Markdown gives the user greater control over their text while streamlining the process of coding using github and improves functionality overall. It uses text structures to generate HTML.
