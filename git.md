#### Git

Git is a Distributed version control system that was created by Linus Torvalds, the creator of the Linux Kernel. It's purpose was to replace the bitkeeper DVCS. 

It allows developers to collaborate on a project from their own computers. It does this by taking snapshots of a developers project as they work on it and upload it into the main project. This allows easier fixes if bugs arise & mitigates the risk of data corruption and loss.
