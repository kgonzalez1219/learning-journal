##### How Computers Work

Computers are broken up into two differnt parts. The **Hardware** and the **Software**. The haredware includes things like the monitor, mouse, keayboard and speakers whie the software is comprised of all the inner workings that are used to control the hardware.

At it's base a computer is run by an **Operating System** or OS that controls the CPU or **Central Processing Unit**. The CPU is responsible for taking data input by the user, storing it and then processsing it to create the appropriate output. For example, a calculater. 

This is accomplished through the use of **Binary** which is a language used by the computer to translate input into 0's and 1's which correlate to different electrical signals that run through the computers circuits.
