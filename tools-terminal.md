Using a terminal is basically talking to a system at deeper level than just the typical Graphical User Interface or GUI.

Some terminolgy I ran across during my reading:

* **Shell** - Defines how the terminal will behave & runs and executes commands.
* **BASH** - Stands for Bourne again Shell & is the most common type of shell.
* **Terminal** - Also referred to as the command Line. Text based way to communicate with the system. 
* **GUI** - Stands for Graphical User Interface.
* **PWD** - Print Working Directory

These are just a few of **MANY** neew terms.
