Loops check a condition, if it returns true a code block will run and be checked again. This will continue until it comes back false.

Some loop types are as follows:

+ for - the for loop is for when you need to run a code for a specific amount of times. It is the most common loop. Often used for arrays.
+ while - while loops are used when a code needs to be run an indeterminate amount of times. It will continue to run as long as the output continues to be true.

Some key words pertaining to loops:

+ Break - Terminates the loop
+ Continue - tells when to stop & check the condition
