#### HTML

Hyper text mark up language, or **HTML** is used to build the basic structure of a webpage. It is made up of what are called **tags** or **elements**.

## The Wireframe

An important element of designing a webpage using html is to first sketch out a basic **wireframe** or rough draft of what you want it to look like. This gives you a working image to go off of when typing out your code. 

According to Jon Duckett in his book HTML & CSS
>The primary aim of any kind of visual design is to communicate. Organizing and prioritizing information on a page heps users understand its importance and what order to read it in.
